HeartVoice
==========
This is an android app designed for deaf-mutes. This app could recognize speech to words and synthesize words to voice, it also
preconfigurs some frequent and common use sentences. 

We use PhoneGap as a platform to develop it, including some js library like jqMobi and jQUi. We use iflytek's speech recognition
and synthesis api to process voice and words.
